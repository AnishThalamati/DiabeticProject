Project description:
This project was a personal project done with a friend of mine with his own data sets. He gave his diabetic records for analysis to develop visualizations from them

Objective of the model:
To find any relation between the blood glucose levels, location history, sleep duration and walking time

Overview:
Supervised learning method was used.
Set of predictors used (independent variables):
blood glucose levels
location history
sleep duration
walking time 

Data cleaning:
Done using a Jupiter notebook
Cleaned manually for null values in historic_glucose
Null values were populated with current_glucose values
4-hour time bins were created
All the individual data sets were linked based on the time bins

Model application:
Packages used:
Pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, data util
Visualization of this was also done in “Tableau”
Acknowledgements:
Dmitri for sharing the data sets
